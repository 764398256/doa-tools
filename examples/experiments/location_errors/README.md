## About

This folder contains scripts for analyzing the performance of SS-MUSIC and DA-MUSIC for various sparse linear arrays in the presence of sensor location errors. You can use these scripts to produce figures similar to those in my following paper:

```
@article{wang_performance_2018,
    title = {Performance Analysis of Coarray-Based {MUSIC} in the Presence of Sensor Location Errors},
    volume = {66},
    issn = {1053-587X},
    doi = {10.1109/TSP.2018.2824283},
    number = {12},
    journal = {IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing},
    author = {Wang, M. and Zhang, Z. and Nehorai, A.},
    month = jun,
    year = {2018},
    pages = {3074--3085}
}
```

Note that in the paper we use the term "location errors". In the scripts we use "position errors", which has exactly the same meaning.
